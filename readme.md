<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>Our story revolves around Aldo and his twin brother Ivan. For as long as he can remember, Aldo has been perfectly content living a quiet life in familiar surroundings: seeing familiar faces, eating familiar food, smelling familiar scents, and hearing familiar sounds.</p>

<p>Ivan, in stark contrast, is a driven adventurer. He is drawn to the unknown and is engaged in a constant search for new lands, new treasures, and new stories.</p>

<p>While Aldo and Ivan live in the same small island town, Ivan is seldom there for more than a week while Aldo has never set foot on the mainland.</p>

<p>Aldo likes his life, but when he wakes suddenly on a rainy summer night with a terrible vision, everything changes.</p>

<h3 id="story-ch1">Chapter 1 - The Unlikely Hero</h3>
<p>Aldo sat upright in his bed, breathing heaviliy. He had just had a dream that his twin brother, Ivan, was in mortal danger. The next day Aldo talks to people in town, and someone suggests he sees a wizard who specializes in twin magic, Ydora...</p>

<p><em>TODO: Add story about sword.</em></p>

<p>(Aldo must get the sword before leaving town)</p>

<h3 id="story-ch2">Chapter 2 - The Great Wizard</h3>
<p>The road to Ydora's is fraught with danger. But by fighting things off with the sword, Aldo grows fond of the tattered blade. Ydora interprets the dream to be true, and tells Aldo of the evil menace Jathanza and the prophecy of his defeat. The prophecy is that the twin of Jathanza's sacrifice will rise to the occasion and save his brother from death. The twin will weild an dual elemental sword to defeat Jathanza.</p>

<p>Ydora explained that there were three swords, all capable of defeating Jathanza if paired with the correct element. A wooden sword, a stone sword, and a metal sword. The wooden sword came from the elves, in deep in the Western Woodlands. The stone sword came from giants, in the Hills of Yold. And lastly, the metal sword was forged by the dwarves in the Anjir Mountains.</p>

<p>Ydora continued, telling Aldo a tale of three elemental fragments, that could be combined with any one of the swords forged by the nation's inhabitants. There was a fire fragment, an ice fragment, and a thunder fragment.</p>

<h3 id="story-ch3">Chapter 3 - The Choice of Power</h3>
<p>(Chapter 3 branches based on which elemental fragment Aldo chooses to pursue.)</p>
<p>Aldo follows a path to the center of the land, where the road splits in 4 directions. <em>North</em> is the temple of Jathanza, where you can only go after attaining a charged dual elemental sword. <em>North-East</em> is the mountain coast, and off the shores, the ice mountain. <em>West</em> is the path to the dessert. <em>East</em> is the path to

<h3 id="story-ch3b">Chapter 3B - Tha Path of Ice</h3>
<p>(Aldo chooses the path to the ice fragment).</p>
<p>Aldo adventures through valleys and up the mountain (stopping at a couple more locations, able to obtain a pick axe) and eventually encounters a great pheonix that can fly him to an isolated mountain on an island at sea.</p>
<p>Aldo flies to the sea mountain and enters it's dark cave. He fights through an army of ice spirits, and the great ice spirit.</p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing Guide</h2>
If you enjoy the game and wish to contribute, that's great! In order to keep things consistent with the graphics style, story and world designs, I unfortunately need to be quite strict about what is merged into the <em>master</em> branch / official build.
That being said, I have created a second branch called <em>community</em> which is the official community build of the game. I'm much more lenient about what gets merged into this branch. As long as your code doesn't break anything or cause any major gameplay issues, go nuts!
