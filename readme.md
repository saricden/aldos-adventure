<h1>Aldo's Adventure</h1>
An open source, free to play game with zero monetization (no ads, no mircrotransactions, etc). I'm building this for players to enjoy, as well as an example for those who are interested in learning game development.

Play it, fork it, mod it, learn from it, but most of all have fun.

<em>This readme is a living document, and will be updated as the game grows and progresses.</em>

<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
Our story revolves around Aldo and his twin brother Ivan. For as long as he can remember, Aldo has been perfectly content living a quiet life in familiar surroundings: seeing familiar faces, eating familiar food, smelling familiar scents, and hearing familiar sounds.
Ivan, in stark contrast, is a driven adventurer. He is drawn to the unknown and is engaged in a constant search for new lands, new treasures, and new stories.
While Aldo and Ivan live in the same small island town, Ivan is seldom there for more than a week while Aldo has never set foot on the mainland.
Aldo likes his life, but when he wakes suddenly on a rainy summer night with a terrible vision, everything changes.

If you enjoy the game and wish to contribute, that's great! In order to keep things consistent with the graphics style, story and world designs, I unfortunately need to be quite strict about what is merged into the <em>master</em> branch / official build.
That being said, I have created a second branch called <em>community</em> which is the official community build of the game. I'm much more lenient about what gets merged into this branch. As long as your code doesn't break anything or cause any major gameplay issues, go nuts!
