<p class="flow-text">Vanset Isle, Avon's home for 70 years.</p>
<p>I decided to draw a picture of Avon's hometown using my Wacom Intuos tablet, this time to practice drawing scenery.</p>
<p>The drawing took around 3 or 4 hours, but I wasn't paying too much attention to the time... It's coloured in the same kind of lo-fi style that I think will become the art style of this game.</p>
