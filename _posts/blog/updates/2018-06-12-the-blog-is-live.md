<p class="flow-text">As of June 12, 2018, Avon's Adventure officially has a live blog!</p>

<p>It's totally responsive because it's 2018 and people browse the web on a lot of devices. I used <a href="//materializecss.com/" target="_blank">Materialize</a> CSS framework to rapid prototype the design and I have to say, I'm very happy with the experience.</p>

<p>Materialize provided a lot of boilerplate styling which I found tasteful and well thought out. On top of that it provided a variety of visual components such as nav bars, cards, buttons, footers, etc. And of course Materialize ships with a responsive grid system, much like that of <a href="//getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="//foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>A little more about Materialize?</p>

<p>Okay, well another thing I like is how <a href="//material.io/design/" target="_blank">Google's Material Design</a> (which Materialze is based on) gives apps and websites tools to uniquely brand themselves while simultaneously belonging to a larger "stylistic ecosystem". In other words it's a way to style apps and sites in such a way that they look unique, yet fit in with one another so they can be displayed harmoniously together.</p>

<p>From a developer point of view, I'm happy to report that Materialize is very easy to configure globally via it's <em>_variables.scss</em> file, and can be extended and customized with your own CSS (or SASS) with ease.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about Materialize take a look at their <a href="//materializecss.com/getting-started.html" target="_blank">official documentation</a>, and if you end up using it for a project, consider supporting the developers with a <a href="//www.patreon.com/materialize" target="_blank">monthly donation on Patreon</a>.</p>
