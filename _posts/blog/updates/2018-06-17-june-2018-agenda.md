<p class="flow-text">Avon spritesheet, Vanset Isle map and mobile controller.</p>

<p>Pretty straightforward, in what's left of June 2018, I hope to get three things accomplished:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avon spritesheet #1</li>
  <li>Vanset Isle Map</li>
  <li>Mobile controller</li>
</ol>

<h3>Avon spritesheet #1</h3>
<p>The first complete spritesheet for Avon will include a walk cycle, jump / fall, idle, and a push animation. This version will depict him without a sword, however he will still have his utility belt. I'll be drawing everything using my Intuos Wacom Tablet, in the free, open source program <a href="//www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>.</p>

<h3>Vanset Isle Map</h3>
<p>This will be the first map of the game. In order to make it, I'll first need to create a tileset of the basic building blocks of Vanset Isle. For this I'll also be using GIMP. After getting a few tiles down (I'll add to the set as I build out the map), I'll be building the map using yet another free & open source program: <a href="//www.mapeditor.org/" target="_blank">Tiled</a>.</p>

<h3>Mobile controller</h3>
<p>Version 0.01 of Avon's Adventure already has working keyboard controls (WSAD), however the mobile controller for touch screens is a bit buggy. I plan on improving it as best as I can, reaching out to fellow developers or going on a Google rampage if I get stuck. The controller and all other code in the game is written in JavaScript, and is built utilizing the fantastic <a href="//phaser.io/" target="_blank">Phaser Framework V3</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can get through these tasks in time, but it's a little hard to say if I will or not, as my job is currently quite demanding. Hopefully! Will check back in at the beginning of July to see how we did :)</p>
